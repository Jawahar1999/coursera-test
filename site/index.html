				<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
				<P>
					Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.

			<h2>VARIETY OF FOODS</h2>
				<p>
				 Having a varied diet means eating a wide variety of different foods from the different food groups, as well as within each food group. Each food group offers a wide range of choices and each one has a unique nutritional value.
                 Diet diversity is well recognized as a key element of high quality diets, as it helps to ensure nutritional adequacy. When your child eats a variety of foods, it increases the likelihood of him or her getting the many types of nutrients which are important for growth and development. On the other hand, when there’s a lack of variety in your child’s diet (e.g. due to picky eating), it may lead to nutritional gaps.

			<h2>HEALTHY FOODS</h2>
			<p>Healthy foods are those that provide you with the nutrients you need to sustain your body’s well-being and retain energy. Water, carbohydrates, fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals are the key nutrients that make up a healthy, balanced diet.
				<ul>
					<li>For a healthy diet, sugars should represent less than 10% of your total energy intake. Reducing even further to under 5% has additional health benefits.</li>
                    <li>Choosing fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate helps reduce consumption of sugars.</li>
                    <li>Limiting intake of soft drinks, soda and other drinks high in sugars (fruit juices, cordials and syrups, flavoured milks and yogurt drinks) also helps reduce intake of sugars.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>JUNK FOODS</h2>
			<p>"Junk food" generally refers to foods that contribute lots of calories but little nutritional value. Of course, what's considered "junk food" depends on whom you ask. Some might say pizza is junk food, for example. But I personally don't think so, since it contributes real food with nutrients, like cheese and tomato sauce. Add whole-wheat or part whole-wheat crust, plus veggies as a topping, and I'd say pizza completely exits the junk food category.

			One problem with junk foods is that they're low in satiation value -- that is, people don't tend to feel as full when they eat them -- which can lead to overeating. Another problem is that junk food tends to replace other, more nutritious foods. When people drink lots of soda, for example, they are usually not getting plenty of low-fat dairy or other healthful beverages like green tea or orange juice. When they're snacking on chips and cookies, they're usually not loading up on fruits and vegetables.

			Most "junk food" falls into the categories of either "snack food" or "fast food." And then there are things like breakfast cereals. They seem innocent enough, but some of them could definitely be considered "junk food," as they mostly contain sugar or high-fructose corn syrup and white flour or milled corn.

			<h2>DISADVANTAGE OF FOODS</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>You have to do most of the processing yourself. Whole grain flour apart from wheat is not readily available and sometimes not properly cleaned so you have to clean and grind them yourself. As a lot of natural foods come in their natural state you have to flavour them to make them delicious to most people.</li>
				<li>There are very few recipes for the not so popular ones like millet, guinea corn etc for people who want to try them out.</li>
				<li>Some of them are acquired tastes for many people which discourages people from trying them out.</li>
				<li>Whole grain pastries are usually heavy and more often than not have surface cracks when cooked. Also they are sometimes difficult to handle during preparation.</li>
				<li>Double cream which is used a lot in decorating pastries has to be used minimally and therefore they are not always as attractive as regular pastries.</li>
